                <p>Hans Beekmans has dedicated his life to being a professional in every endeavour he has pursued. As a dentist, he has excelled to the point of being the trusted dentist to the King and Queen of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>Yet, despite providing the best dental care, Hans became frustrated at the ever-increasing occurrence of dental issues, such as cavities, teeth grinding and undeveloped jaws—why did such things continue to occur even in those who followed recommended practise of flossing, teeth brushing and avoiding sugar?</p>
                <p>After years of research Hans Beekmans found that the answer did not lie in more complicated and costly dental procedures, but rather the answer was very simple and affordable to all. </p>
                <p>“I became convinced that good health begins at the cellular level. Our body’s cells require essential nutrients and minerals to generate energy and perform their functions effectively. Without optimal cell function, the foundation of your health weakens because the body will extract its needed minerals from bones and tissue—a process known as demineralisation. I wondered if supplying the minerals in supplement form would re-mineralise the body and halt this process.”</p>
                <p>Hans put his theories to the test by recommending his patient take specific dosages of vitamins and minerals to help improve their teeth.</p>
                <p>“I observed first hand the improvements in health, not just in the gums and teeth, but the overall wellbeing of my patients.” </p>
                <p>But once again, Hans had to return to more dedicated research, as he found that most supplements on the market did not contain the appropriate ratios of minerals and vitamins, nor were they designed for optimal absorption. </p>
                <p>“Not many people realise that vitamins and minerals work in exact ratios. Too much of one mineral can create a deficiency in another. Furthermore, certain minerals require the right environment in order to be absorbed by the body. That’s why I developed a compact range of supplements, with precise ratios and guidelines, to support a healthy lifestyle and I believe these to be most effective in improving the health of my patients.”</p>

            <h2>The Calcium Magnesium Ratio</h2>
            <p>Calcium and magnesium is best taken in a ratio of 2:1 in a dissolved acidic state. We achieve this by adding apple cider vinegar. Calcium needs an acidic environment to be absorbed in the intestines, but with magnesium added, the environment becomes alkaline. Apple cider vinegar provides the acidic environment and therefore good absorption.</p>
