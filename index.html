            <p>Mikel is an entrepreneur based in Sydney, Australia, who travels frequently to the USA and Asia. His name is pronounced exactly like “Michael.” 
He was fortunate to receive a computer in the early 1980s and had access to the internet within its first years of availability. He knew from a young age that the world would become connected and that he would be part of that transformation. 
University couldn’t hold his interest, so he dropped out to pursue his goals. After five years in the IT industry, he built a highly successful ISP from the ground up, helped establish the Victorian Internet Exchange, and immersed himself in learning. 
He has founded several IT companies, including Flood.IO, reinteractive, and MetaPulse, and was involved with Tricentis through the acquisition of Flood.IO. He exited Flood.IO and Tricentis to focus on reinteractive and MetaPulse. 
In 2017, he founded StoreConnect to help small to medium businesses worldwide scale their online, eCommerce, and POS solutions on Salesforce. He also created the Ruby Mail gem and contributed to modifying the Rails ActionMailer library to use Mail as its email library, earning him an invitation to become Australia’s first member of the Ruby on Rails commit team, of which he is now an alumnus.
